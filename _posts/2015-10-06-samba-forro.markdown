The Brazilian mix. Shot of #samba. Shot of #forró. Don't stir it. Shake it.

We will take you into a deep journey of the roots of the #Brazilian culture, with #Samba & #Forró. We will start the night honouring the most authentic "Samba de Raiz": from Clara Nunes to Fundo de Quintal, via the most popular tunes made by Paulinho da Viola, Cartola, Candeia and many others. Then, is time dance "Forró" in pairs --and very close together-- while we play the most organic Xote, Baião and Arrasta-pé. Do not miss this opportunity to enjoy the best of the Brazilian #samba & #forró!
