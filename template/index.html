        <p>On the tambourines, an Indian woman and a man from Martinique, on the
acoustic bass an Italian, on the Berimbau an Argentine. The voices of the
Brazilian female choir, specially trained for the exhibition, mix with the
sound of the strings and agogô played by their countrymen, while in the
audience men and women from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Australia,
England, Canada, United States, Japan, Italy, Indonesia, China and
Colombia dance the samba and play capoeira among paintings, drawings
and photos that portray grand masters of these genres, interspersed with
African fabrics used by their ancestors. Samba is not only a musical genre,
it is a way of thinking about living, it is a living culture. Magnet Gallery was
the space chosen not only to display but above all to create art,
collectively. It was a space where women had a central role,
deconstructing the macho image propagated in the media about samba and
the carioca carnival.
</p>
<p>
Like Milton Santos, the Afro-Brazilian geographer, I believe that the
fundamental role of contemporary art is to boost what he conceptualized
as ‘Another Globalization’. Globalize knowledge and its use. In the network
of human relations and geographic spaces, value the singular amidst the
totality. Solidarity gave birth to Samba, and Samba gives birth to Solidarity.
</p>
<p>In 2018 the theme was SAVE THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON. It is a direct manifesto of keeping the
lush forests in our wetlands or not. The name of an entire nation can not only be associated with
a type of complete hair removal in the pussy and in the hoof.</p>
<p>Everyone has hair and everything is beautiful and wonderful. Let&#39;s protect our forests!
Bring your instruments, drinks and costumes! Call your friends. We are bringing a big cooler but
feel free to bring more!</p>


            <h2 class="content-subhead">Womb of Samba</h2>
<p>
Samba was born in “Pequena África”, a neighbourhood surrounding the
wharf of Valongo, through which close to 2 million enslaved Africans
entered Rio de Janeiro. Specifically, Samba was born in the house of Tio
Ciata of Oshun (Hilária Batista de Almeida) who arrived in Rio de Janeiro
from Bahia in 1876 at the age of 22.
</p>
<p>´Pelo Telefone’, was the first samba song to be recorded, in 1916 by
Donga. It was composed in Tia Ciata´s
